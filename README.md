Contao File Usage
=================

This Contao extension allows you to find and display file references of your files managed by the file manager.

## Implement Custom Provider

Currently this extension can find any references created by the `fileTree` input field of any (database based) DCA and it can find any
references from `{{file::*}}`, `{{picture::*}}` and `{{figure::*}}` insert tags in any text based fields in the database. If you want to
expand this search to other locations you can implement your own _file usage provider_ by implementing the `FileUsageProviderInterface`.

```php
// src/FileUsage/FoobarProvider.php
use InspiredMinds\ContaoFileUsage\Provider\FileUsageProviderInterface;
use InspiredMinds\ContaoFileUsage\Result\DatabaseReferenceResult;
use InspiredMinds\ContaoFileUsage\Result\Results;

class FoobarProvider implements FileUsageProviderInterface
{
    public function find(string $uuid): Results
    {
        $results = new Results($uuid);

        // Additional database search
        // â€¦

        $results->addResult(new DatabaseReferenceResult($table, $field, $id));

        return $results;
    }
}
```

That is all you need to do, if you enabled `autoconfigure` for your service. Otherwise you will also need to tag the service with
`contao_file_usage.provider` manually.

You might want or need to implement a new result container using the `ResultInterface` for your purposes (e.g. if your provider looks in
the contents of files, rather than the database for example, which this extension currently does not do by default).

## File Replacements

This extension also replaces Contao's `fileTree` widget with its own implementation, showing an additional button with which you can replace
the file references found for this file with a new reference.
