Contao File Usage
=================

This Contao extension allows you to find and display file references of your files managed by the file manager. For each
file in the file manager there will be a new operation (<img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/inspiredminds/contao-file-usage/master/public/search.svg" alt="search"> or <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/inspiredminds/contao-file-usage/master/public/link.svg" alt="link">).

This operation will then show you any references of this file that this extension finds in the database, with links to
the original data record, if available.

You can also use the "Unused files" global operation in order to find any database assisted files that aren't referenced
anywhere (at least according to the search results).

## Custom Providers

Currently this extension can find any references created by the `fileTree` input field of any (database based) DCA and 
it can find any references from `{{file::*}}`, `{{picture::*}}` and `{{figure::*}}` insert tags in any text based fields 
in the database. If you want to expand this search to other locations you can implement your own _file usage provider_ 
by implementing the `FileUsageProviderInterface`.

```php
// src/FileUsage/FoobarProvider.php
use InspiredMinds\ContaoFileUsage\Provider\FileUsageProviderInterface;
use InspiredMinds\ContaoFileUsage\Result\DatabaseReferenceResult;
use InspiredMinds\ContaoFileUsage\Result\Results;

class FoobarProvider implements FileUsageProviderInterface
{
    public function find(string $uuid): Results
    {
        $results = new Results($uuid);

        // Additional database search
        // â€¦

        $results->addResult(new DatabaseReferenceResult($table, $field, $id));

        return $results;
    }
}
```

That is all you need to do, if you enabled `autoconfigure` for your service. Otherwise you will also need to tag the 
service with `contao_file_usage.provider` manually.

You might want or need to implement a new result container using the `ResultInterface` for your purposes (e.g. if your 
provider looks in the contents of files, rather than the database for example, which this extension currently does not 
do by default).

## File Replacements

This extension also replaces Contao's `fileTree` widget with its own implementation, showing an additional button with 
which you can replace the file references found for this file with a new reference.
